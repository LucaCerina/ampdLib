# Automatic Multiscale-based Peak Detection (AMPD)

ampdLib implements automatic multiscale-based peak detection (AMPD) algorithm
as in An Efficient Algorithm for Automatic Peak Detection in Noisy Periodic and
Quasi-Periodic Signals, by Felix Scholkmann, Jens Boss and Martin Wolf,
Algorithms 2012, 5, 588-603.

### Python required dependencies
- Python > 3
- Numpy
- Scipy for tests

### Tests
The tests folder contains an ECG signal with annotated peaks in matlab format.
